As a stand-alone program, it can create a new gist from files listed as\r\narguments, or by reading from STDIN.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nGista is distributed as a Ruby gem, which should be installed on most Macs and\r\nLinux systems. Once you have ensured you have a working installation of Ruby\r\nand Ruby gems, install the gem as follows from the command line:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install gista\r\n\r\nYou can verify the gem has installed correctly by checking its version number:\r\n\r\n    $ gista -v\r\n\r\nIf this generates an error, something has gone wrong. You should see something\r\nalong the lines of `gista 1.0.0`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou can list one or more filenames as an argument:\r\n\r\n    $ gista filename1 filename2...\r\n\r\nOr, you can read content from STDIN:\r\n\r\n    $ echo \"Hello, world!\" | gista\r\n\r\nWhen reading from STDIN one file will be created, by default called `untitled`.\r\nYou can override this name:\r\n\r\n    $ echo \"Hello, world!\" | gista -f \"my new gist\"\r\n\r\nBy default, new gists are private. You can make a public gist with the `-p`\r\noption:\r\n\r\n    $ gista -p filename1\r\n    $ gista --public filename1\r\n\r\nWhen everything went according to plan, the program will output the URL to\r\nthe newly created gist.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Gista as a Ruby library, take a look at the `bin/gista`\r\nfile for an example how to use it:\r\n\r\n    authoriser = Gista::TokenRequest.new(Gista::LoginPrompt.new)\r\n    token      = Gista::UserToken.new(authoriser).token\r\n    options    = Gista::Options.new(ARGV).options\r\n    puts Gista.post_and_get_url(token, options)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nSee the inline [API\r\ndocs](http://rubydoc.info/github/avdgaag/gista/master/frames) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n### Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n\r\n1. Fork the project.\r\n2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version\r\n   unintentionally.\r\n4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have\r\n   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can\r\n   ignore when I pull)\r\n5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues, defects or suggestions in the [Github issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/avdgaag/gista/issues).\r\n\r\n### What has changed?\r\n\r\nSee the [HISTORY](https://github.com/avdgaag/gista/blob/master/HISTORY.md) file\r\nfor a detailed changelog.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nCreated by: Arjan van der Gaag  \r\nURL: [http://arjanvandergaag.nl](http://arjanvandergaag.nl)  \r\nProject homepage: [http://avdgaag.github.com/gista](http://avdgaag.github.com/gista)  \r\nDate: april 2012  \r\nLicense: [MIT-license](https://github.com/avdgaag/gista/blob/master/LICENSE) (same as Ruby)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
